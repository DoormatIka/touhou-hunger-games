# touhou-hunger-games

This is a project I'm working on that takes inspiration from BrantSteele's Hunger Games Simulator and ZUN's Touhou Series.

This is meant to be the core codebase of the website this game will run in.

Planned features for a **Beta Release**:
  - The Entire Human Village, featuring 50 houses.
  - Players can move around in the world controlled by random chance via paths. (Graph data structures baby!)
  - Fighting other players, of course.
  - Events whenever someone dies.
  - 10 players is the limit.
  - Will be played via CLI.
    - The website will be hosted on an alpha release.
